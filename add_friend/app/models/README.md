# Friend Request Model Overview ðŸ“„

The **models** folder contains the data models that define the structure and relationships for the entities in the Friends Service domain. Specifically, the `friend_request.py` model defines the structure of the data related to friend requests.

## Purpose ðŸŽ¯
The **friend_request.py** model is used to structure and validate the data associated with a friend request. It defines the attributes and relationships required for the system to handle adding friends, including the necessary user information for each friend request.

This model acts as a schema for friend requests and provides a clear structure for the incoming data from the API, ensuring that all required information is included when a user tries to send a friend request.

## Functionality ðŸ”§
- **Data Structure**: The model defines the fields that make up a friend request, including user details (e.g., email of the user and the friend they wish to add).
- **Validation**: It ensures that the data received is in the correct format and contains all the necessary attributes for a valid friend request.
- **Integration**: The model works with other parts of the system, like the API and the service layers, to process the friend request according to the business logic.

This model is fundamental to ensuring that friend requests are properly structured, validated, and processed within the **Friends Service** domain.
